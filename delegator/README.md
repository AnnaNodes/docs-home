# Delegator

Delegators secure the Harmony block chain by delegating native ONE tokens to the validators and earning rewards.

If you cannot guarantee running a node with 100% uptime but still want to participate in open staking, you can delegate your tokens to a preferred validator and share his rewards. Your delegation will influence a validator's voting power and return, thus by selecting performing validators, you are contributing to the security of the blockchain and optimizing your return.

Your delegated tokens are also associated with slashing risks of the validator. As a delegator, you should carefully choose validators based on their historical performance metrics such as APR, uptime and commission. In case of indifference or indecisiveness, you should distribute your delegations among multiple validators in order to minimize risk.
