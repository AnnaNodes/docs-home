# Delegator Journey \(video\)

Harmony's revolutionary Effective Proof of Stake mechanism \([https://youtu.be/M8c06bxWyQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8c06bxWyQc)\) is the fairest yet for allowing open participation in a public blockchain. 

In this video we run through the journey of the Delegator getting started in staking through the full-featured dashboard. With the introduction of effective stake, higher ranked validators are actually economically punished to stake too much in a single validator and the lower-ranked validators are enjoying extra reward for their stake. The effective stake is acting as an equalizer that pushes for a more evenly distributed stake among validators, thus avoiding stake centralization.
