# Collect Rewards

### 1. Sending a Collect Rewards Transaction

You can simply collect rewards for your validator with the following command:

```bash
auto-node collect-rewards
```

### 2. \(Optional\) Send funds to your 'main' wallet

If you have followed the recommended method of creating a wallet just for running a validator, you can send funds to your 'main' wallet with the following steps.

First, get the balance of your validator wallet with the following command:

```bash
auto-node balances
```

Note the `shard 0` balance, this is where the rewards get deposited.   
Next, transfer the funds to your 'main' wallet with the following command:

```bash
validator_addr=$(auto-node config | jq '.["validator-addr"]' -r)
auto-node hmy transfer -n https://api.s0.t.hmny.io/ --from-shard 0 --to-shard 0 \
  --from $validator_addr --to <main-wallet-address> --amount <amount> --passphrase
```

> Substitute `<main-wallet-address>` with the ONE address of your main wallet.  
> Substitute `<amount>` with how much you want to transfer from your validator wallet.
