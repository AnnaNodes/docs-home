# Adding A Validator Logo

### Uploading A Custom Logo <a id="uploading-a-custom-logo"></a>

1. Fork this github repo: [https://github.com/harmony-one/validator-logos](https://github.com/harmony-one/validator-logos)â€‹

2. Add your logo by creating the logo image name using your Harmony one address as the file name and placing it inside "validators" folder. The logo image needs to be a .jpg file with 256x256 pixels or 512x512 pixels.  
  
Example: validators/one1pdv9lrdwl0rg5vglh4xtyrv3wjk3wsqket7zxy.jpg

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not upload the .jpg file in the main repository directory. It must be inside the "validators" directory.
{% endhint %}

3. Create a pull request for your changes. A Harmony team member will review the image & approve it.

### Keybase

If you have a Keybase account & have put your PGP public key finger print as your "identity", your Keybase profile picture will automatically be used for your validator image!
