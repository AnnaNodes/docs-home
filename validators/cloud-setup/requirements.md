# Requirements

{% hint style="success" %}
We recommend that you run two nodes on two different regions around the globe for **better signing rate** and **high availability**. Differently from other blockchains, Harmony allows you to run multiple nodes with the same BLS keys. This is not considered double signing.  
  
One configuration is positioning one node in America and another one with the same BLS keys in Asia or Europe, for example.
