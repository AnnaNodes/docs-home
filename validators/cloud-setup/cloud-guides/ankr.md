# Ankr

{% hint style="danger" %}
Ankr is **not optimized for mainnet** yet, and the "Harmony card" referenced below is not currently available. We will update this notification once the necessary upgrades have been completed.  
****  
**Use "**[**First Time Setup**](../../node-setup/manual-setup/)**" to spin up your validator node!**  
{% endhint %}

## Deploying a Harmony Node on Ankr

1. Head to [app.ankr.com](http://app.ankr.com/) to deploy and select **Deploy A Node**

2. Scroll down to find the Harmony card, hover over it and press **Deploy** 

3. The hardware configuration is already set at the optimal system requirements. The platform also recommends a cluster, which is usually the one that has the most freely available resources. In this particular case, the recommended cluster is UK cluster, but another cluster may be recommended depending on your location.

4. In order to deploy the Node, Ankr will generate a BLS Key and a Harmony Wallet for you. For security reasons, these two keys will be encoded with a password that must be set in the **Encryption Password** field. Please make sure to write this password somewhere safe in order to regain access to your keys.

5. Next, you need to insert a node name in order to identify and get realtime stats of the node on the [Harmony Validator Explorer](https://staking.harmony.one/validators), once your node is elected as a Validator.

6. If you are using the application for the first time, you need to generate a deposit address by clicking Create Unique Address. When the address is generated, click **Deploy Node** to finish the Harmony Open Staking node deployment.

2. In order to be eligible for a Validator seat, you need to have ONE tokens in your wallet. You can transfer ONE tokens from any wallet to the generated ONE wallet address from the **Information** tab.

3. Once the ONE tokens are visible in your token wallet, you can **Apply** for a Validator spot.
