# Terms & Concepts

Harmony is one of the first production mainnets to feature a fully sharded PoS architecture. Across the 4 shards in Harmony mainnet, blocks are produced every 8 seconds and cross-shard transactions are finalized in 2 block times.

Harmonyâ€™s Effective Proof-of-Stake \(EPoS\) is the first staking mechanism in a sharded blockchain that achieves both security and decentralization. EPoS allows staking from hundreds of validators and the unique **effective stake** mechanism reduces the tendency of stake centralization. Meanwhile, stake delegation, reward compounding, double-sign slashing, and unavailability checking are also supported.

Our token economics model incentivizes early stakers with higher rewards to bootstrap the network successfully. For those validators or delegators who would like to join [Harmony Open Staking](http://staking.harmony.one/), this section will help you get started and learn about how everything works.
