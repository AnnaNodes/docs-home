# Node Setup

You can choose to run your node either via [AutoNode](autonode-setup/) or via [Manual Setup](manual-setup/). 

AutoNode allows you to spin up a node seamlessly and automate common validator actions while the Manual Setup allows you do have **full control** of the whole setup process, while many of the common validator actions will have to done manually.
