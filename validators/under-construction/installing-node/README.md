# Installing Node

There are three ways of installing the Node:

* [Using Binary CLI](using-binary-cli.md) \(**recommended**\): Binary CLI allows you to have full control of all the node configuration settings. Node configuration with this option is manual.
* [Using AutoNode](../upgrading-node/using-autonode.md) \(**recommended**\): AutoNode allows you to spin up a node seamlessly and automate common validator actions. Node configuration with this option is automated.
* [Using Node.sh](using-node.sh.md) \(not recommended\): Node.sh is a wrapper to run the Binary CLI. It will be deprecated and is not recommended for new installations.
* Tmux + CLI \(not recommended\): Node configuration if you are using Tmux \(please keep in mind that we recomend Systemd Service
