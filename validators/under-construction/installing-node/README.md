# Installing Node

There are three ways of installing the Node:

* [Using Binary CLI](setup-node/using-binary-cli.md) \(**recommended**\): Binary CLI allows you to have full control of all the node configuration settings. Node configuration with this option is manual.
* [Using AutoNode](https://docs.harmony.one/home/validators/under-construction/installing-node/using-autonode/install-and-run) \(**recommended**\): AutoNode allows you to spin up a node seamlessly and automate common validator actions. Node configuration with this option is automated.
* [Using Node.sh](https://docs.harmony.one/home/validators/under-construction/installing-node/using-node.sh) \(not recommended\): Node.sh is a wrapper to run the Binary CLI. It will be deprecated and is not recommended for new installations.
* [Using Tmux + Binary CLI](https://docs.harmony.one/home/validators/under-construction/installing-node/using-tmux-+-binary-cli) \(not recommended\): Node configuration with Tmux \(please keep in mind that donÂ´t recommend Tmux\) + Binary CLI. Node configuration with this option is manual.
