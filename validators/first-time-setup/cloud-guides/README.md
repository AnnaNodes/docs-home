# Cloud Guides

We have written a guide for setting up a Harmony node for [Amazon Web Services \(AWS\),](https://github.com/harmony-one/docs-home/tree/4edcc27437546acee5c404e95c2c77e099b036ae/validators/first-time-setup/cloud-guides/aws.md) [Vultr](https://docs.harmony.one/validators/validator/first-time-setup/cloud-setup/vultr), [Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\)](https://docs.harmony.one/validators/validator/first-time-setup/cloud-setup/google-cloud) to make things as simple as possible!

If you are curious to know which cloud provider is right for you, read the [**Choosing a cloud provider section**](https://docs.harmony.one/validators/extras/choosing-a-cloud-provider) in the Extras section.

If you choose to use a cloud provider different from those listed above, you are best off to follow the [Vultr](https://docs.harmony.one/validators/validator/first-time-setup/cloud-setup/vultr) guide step by step but be aware that some steps will be different.
