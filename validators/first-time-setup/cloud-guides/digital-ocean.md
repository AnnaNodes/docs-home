Choose now your desired Linux image. We recommend either the latest **LTS version of Ubuntu** or the latest version of **Debian**. Use the left and right arrows to navigate between the different plans available. Choose the "Standard" plan and then select a virtual machine with at least 2 CPUs, 4GB of RAM and 80GB SSD.

You can select the datacenter region of your choice here. We chose "Frankurt" in our example. Use the "SSH Keys" as your authentication method \(more secure\). A button with the name "New SSH key" will appear on screen, just click on it.
