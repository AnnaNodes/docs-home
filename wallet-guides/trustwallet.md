## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

Please note that Trustwallet **does not support the sharded network** architecture yet. The users of Trustwallets will only be able to view and access their funds in Shard-0, and are not able to perform cross-shard transactions using this wallet.

Trustwallet currently uses Shard-0. If you prefer to use Trustwallet regularly, we suggest that you **transfer the necessary funds into Shard-0** using another wallet listed in this guide.



### Receiving transactions in Trustwallet

If you receive funds in another shard other than Shard-0, you may not be able to view the incoming transaction in your Trustwallet app. &lt;What if we import that wallet to somewhere else?&gt;



### Sending transactions in Trustwallet

You can only use the funds in Shard-0, and only perform intrashard transactions.
