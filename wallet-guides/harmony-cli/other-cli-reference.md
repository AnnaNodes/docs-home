# Other CLI reference

For the impatient, use  `./hmy cookbook` to see the most common examples and proper arguments:

Of if you want a full list of commands the `hmy` tool knows in markdown format, please run the following commands: 

```text
$ hmy docs
```

Then in the same directory, `hmy` creates a directory named `hmy-docs` in which you can find all markdown files for the commands and subcommands.
