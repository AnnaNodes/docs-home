# Sending transactions

Make sure you've set up your Math Wallet extension according to the directions in [Download & Setup](https://docs.harmony.one/home/wallet-guides/mathwallet/download-and-setup)

## Opening Web Wallet

You will need to open Web Wallet in order to view account details and perform transactions.

Please select the wallet you want to open and click **Web Wallet** on the Math Wallet extension popover interface:

After clicking **Web Wallet**, you may be presented with a button that says **Login via MathWallet Browser Extension**. Click this button to continue on to the Web Wallet.

## Sending transactions

1. Specify the shard you want to pull funds from using the **Shard** dropdown in the sidebar.
2. Specify which account you want to send funds to using the **To Address** field.
3. Specify which shard you want to send funds to using the **Shard** dropdown to the right.
4. Specify the amount you wish to send in the **Transfer Amount** field.
5. Specify the gas price you wish to pay using the **Fee** slider. _Gas_ is a fee exacted by the network for the computational work of mining a transaction into the blockchain.
6. Click **Transfer** to complete the transaction! You will be shown a **transaction receipt** before finalizing the transaction.

## Switching Networks

If you would like to use Mathwallet to interact with other Harmony networks, you will need to switch network.

In the toolbar at the top of the page, there is a drop down menu which defaults to **Harmony** where you can specify which network you wish to operate on.

* **Harmony** connects to Harmony's mainnet.
* \*\*\*\*[**Pangaea**](https://docs.harmony.one/pangaea/) connects to Testnet
* **Localhost** connects to a [network hosted locally on your machine](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/). This endpoint is only active if you are running a local network on your machine.
