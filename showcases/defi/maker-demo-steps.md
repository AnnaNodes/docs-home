### 3. Click enter amount of ONE to deposit and DAI to create

We suggest starting with 200 ONEs to create 1 DAI. This will make your collateralization ratio 200%.

### 4. Confirm transactions \(x6\) on the pop-up window. You will need to do this 6 times \(apologies\)

Note that batch transactions are shown separately for demo purposes, so it might seem cumbersome at first.

After confirming all 6 transactions, you should see the success message below. This window auto-closes.
