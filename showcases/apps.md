## [**Harmony Soccer Players**](https://soccerplayers.demo.harmony.one/)\*\*\*\*

SoccerPlayers is an NFT collectible game deployed on Harmony blockchain. It is like CryptoKitties, but for collecting your favorite soccer player cards. Each soccer player has a unique token as part of a ERC721 smart contract deployed on Harmony blockchain, that are available to buy. All soccer player cards are open in the market all the time, so that anyone can buy. Every purchase increases the card value by 15%, and the seller will make a profit of 13% when their card is bought by others. A 2% commission is paid to the minting account to cover the app maintenance costs.
