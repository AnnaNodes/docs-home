# Future Plans

### Staking <a href="#docs-internal-guid-2a3117a0-7fff-6cab-a53e-8b5e0f419b1b" id="docs-internal-guid-2a3117a0-7fff-6cab-a53e-8b5e0f419b1b"></a>

Currently the collateral put down by the vaults are solely managed by themselves. In order to reduce the burden on the vaults and also encourage further participation from the community, we plan on introducing a staking mechanism to the bridge such that, the delegators can stake their ONE tokens on behalf of vaults and receive a percentage of the reward and fee.

### Governance

The vaults will collectively decide the future bridge protocol changes under a governance mechanism. There is also the possibility of a bridge governance token(s) (HRC20) airdrops to further incentivize and drive the adoption of the bitcoin bridge. The airdrop will heavily incentivize vaults that provide service for the longer duration.&#x20;
