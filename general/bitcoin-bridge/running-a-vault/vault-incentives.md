# Vault Incentives

The vaults are generously incentivized using the two schemes as described below at the time of launch (subjected to changes, if required).&#x20;

### Bridge Fees

The vaults receive a 0.5% bridge fee from the user on every transaction (issue, redeem) as 1BTC. The 0.5% fee is subject to change, but it is used at the launch time.&#x20;

Example below assumes:

ONE price of $0.34 | BTC price of $43,000.\
Collateral: 200,000 ONE ($68,000)\
Allowed Issuing: 1.05 1BTC ($45,333)

&#x20; **Day 1**: Ten users bridge BTC to 1BTC at a total value of $20,000.

&#x20; **Day 2**: Five of those users redeem BTC at a total value of $10,000.

&#x20; **Day 3**: Ten additional users bridge to 1BTC at a total value of $30,000.

&#x20; **Day 4**: Eight users redeem BTC at a total value of $35,000.

&#x20; **Day 5**: Six users bridge BTC to 1BTC at a total value of $45,000.

**Total amount transacted**: 2.2 BTC valued at $140,000\
**Bridge Fees Collected**: 0.016 1BTC valued at $700

### Staking Rewards

The vaults are rewarded for the amount of collateral that they put in based on the average staking reward rate. Examples below assume a ONE price of $0.34.

**Example 1:**

Collateral: 200,000 ONE\
Staking reward: 18000 annually (@9% APR) or 1500 ONE/month .\
Dollar amount: $6120 per year or $510 per month.

**Example 2:**

Collateral: 2,000,000 ONE\
Staking reward: 180,000 annually (@9% APR) or 15,000 ONE/month.\
Dollar amount: $61,200 per year or $5100 per month.

**Stake APR on collateral depends on length of participation.**&#x20;
