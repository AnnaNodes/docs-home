# Vault Incentives

The vaults are generously incentivized using the two schemes as described below at the time of launch (subjected to changes, if required).&#x20;

### Bridge Fees

The vaults also receive 0.5% in 1BTC as bridge fee from the user on every transaction (issue, redeem). The 0.5% fee is subject to change, but it is used at the launch time. For the above examples (1 & 2), the reward from the fee can be estimated as shown below.

**Example 1:**

Collateral: 200,000 ONE\
Allowed 1BTC issuing: 0.52 1BTC\
Bridge fee: 0.0026 1BTC (0.5% fee rate)\
Dollar amount: $111 (@$43000 /BTC)

**Example 2:**

Collateral: 2,000,000 ONE\
Allowed 1BTC issuing: 10.54 1BTC

### Staking Rewards

The vaults are rewarded for the amount of collateral that they put in based on the average staking reward rate.

**Example 1:**

Collateral: 200,000 ONE\
Staking reward: 18000 annually (@9% APR) or 1500 ONE/month \
Dollar amount: $6120 /year or $510 /month (@$0.34 /ONE)

**Example 2:**

Collateral: 2,000,000 ONE\
Staking reward: 180,000 annually (@9% APR) or 15,000 ONE/month\
Dollar amount: $61,200 /year or $5100 /month (@$0.34 /ONE)
