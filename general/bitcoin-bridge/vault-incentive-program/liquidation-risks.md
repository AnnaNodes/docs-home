# Liquidation Risks

Liquidation (losing your collateral) is a risk to putting your ONE as collateral against bridged Bitcoin.  This serves as a fallback and defense mechanism for those who bridged their BTC in situations where the amount they're holding on your vault cannot be exchanged for a token of equal value.

The image below shows a situation where liquidation of your collateral will occur. Remember, your collateral must always be able to back the value of BTC bridged through your vault. When the balance skews, and your collateral is worth less than the value of BTC bridged on your vault, action must occur to ensure holders of BTC are able to retrieve their funds.
