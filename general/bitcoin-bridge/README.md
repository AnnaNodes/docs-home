# Bitcoin Bridge

Harmony is in the preparation of launching its native bitcoin bridge and requires participation from the community to increase the decentralization and robustness of the bridge. The external participation will happen via running external vaults for the bridge.&#x20;

In this section of our documention, we describe the purpose of a vault, collateral required, incentives to run a vault, how to participate, and our future plans for expanding key features of BTC vaults.
