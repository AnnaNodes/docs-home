# Grant Governors

Grant approvals and governance are solely by members of Harmony Community 🎶, Harmony Angels 😇, elected validators ⛏️, Pangaea Captains ⚔ and Harmonauts 👩‍💻👩‍🚀 \(engineering and business team\).

A governor is responsible for posting their approval of grants publicly in our forum, giving weekly feedback and approval by replying to the projects tweet each Friday. Governors must test and review grantee products before their approval.

Governors will be added to a shared telegram group with the grantee. The estimated time commitment of a governor is 1-3 hours per week.
