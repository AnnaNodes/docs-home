**üßû Governor Group**\
****\
****You have a governor group for your project. There is one person from the [community](https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmony-3x3-interview-questions-on-culture-and-values-b87c8b92774), one [angel](http://harmony.one/angels), one [validator](https://staking.harmony.one/validators/mainnet), one [pangaea captain](https://pops.one), one harmony [biz team](https://harmony.one/team) and one harmony [eng team.](https://harmony.one/team)\
\
Your governors each have unique backgrounds. You should get to know them and how they can help during the grant and after. The governor group will be the main point of contact for everything related to your project - feel free to get feedback from governors and to test your product.\
