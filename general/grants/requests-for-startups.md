# Requests for Startups

Inspired by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/), we started a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/lijiang2087/status/1304289042750607361?s=20) for our own requests for startups. These are the projects we are very interested in working on though we know there will be many great ideas that surprise us as well.

We use Twitter instead of a blog post for faster iteration and broad community engagement.&#x20;

The requests will be in reverse chronological order, with the most recent requests at the top to best reflect our latest thinking.
