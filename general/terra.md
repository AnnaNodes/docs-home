# Bridge Terra UST

## Assumptions

1\) Terra station wallet is installed on your mobile [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/terra-station/aiifbnbfobpmeekipheeijimdpnlpgpp?hl=en) , configured and has required UST. Alternatively, you can use the Terrastation Desktop wallet to interact with Terra network. 

2\) Metamask is installed and configured with Harmony network + wallet.

3\) This guide will explain how to bridge UST from Terra to Harmony using Mobile Terrastation wallet. We will also demonstrate bridging of 1UST from Harmony to Terra using Metamask \(Desktop\).

4\) Please ensure you have sufficient UST to pay for Bridge transaction fees. \(e.g. UST tx fees from Terra to Harmony as of 2021-07-12\)
