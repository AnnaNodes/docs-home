# Important Notice

The LayerZero-Harmony Bridge Interface (“Interface”) is an interface that facilitates use of a third-party cross-chain communication system (“Bridge”) that is designed to enable users to send messages between certain blockchains to enable the exchange of crypto assets between such blockchains. Your use of the Interface and the Bridge is entirely at your own risk.

The Interface and the Bridge are available on an “as is” basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

You assume all risks associated with using the Interface and the Bridge, and digital assets and decentralized systems generally, including but not limited to, that: (a) digital assets are highly volatile; (b) using digital assets is inherently risky due to both features of such assets and the potential unauthorized acts of third parties; (c) you may not have ready access to assets; and (d) you may lose some or all of your tokens or other assets. You agree that you will have no recourse against anyone else for any losses due to the use of the Interface or the Bridge. For example, these losses may arise from or relate to: (i) incorrect information; (ii) software or network failures; (iii) corrupted cryptocurrency wallet files; (iv) unauthorized access; (v) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies; or (vi) third-party activities.

The Interface and the Bridge do not collect any personal data, and your interaction with the Interface and the Bridge will solely be through your public digital wallet address. Any personal or other data that you may make available in connection with the Bridge may not be private or secure.
