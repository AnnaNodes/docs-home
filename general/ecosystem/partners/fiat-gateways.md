## Wyre

We are excited to introduce another way for users to get ONE tokens using Wyre. Users can buy ETH and then use Harmonyâ€™s bridge with Ethereum and decentralized exchange \(DEX\) to swap ONEs. After a user buys ETH using Wyre on Metamask, they can bridge their ETH over to a wrapped version of 1ETH on Harmony and then have the option to swap it to native ONEs on Swoop.
