# Ecosystem

The Harmony team is focused on delivering a strong foundation for our network and ecosystem. We are grateful for the engagement and support of our validators, developers, community members, grantees and collaborators. Our current ecosystem map as of February 2022 is below and only includes a portion of projects launched on the Harmony network.&#x20;
