# Integrations

## Coinbase Rosetta API

Harmony has finished it’s initial integration with the [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org) specification — an open-source framework to simplify blockchain interactions. 

So why did we choose Rosetta? Well, the biggest thing for us is that it allows for **faster onboarding** since it is a standard, **chain agnostic**, framework with sharding as a first-class citizen. Among other things, this greatly reduces interoperability friction between products spanning multiple chains. Moreover, Rosetta’s **growing community** and **tooling** were major factors as it means less effort from the Harmony team is needed to implement and, more importantly, maintain our Node API.

## [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/harmony-one)

By partnering with Gitcoin, Harmony reaffirms its commitment to developers. Overall we’re excited to partner with Gitcoin in our shared goal of growing the web3 open-source ecosystem.

## Magic (Fortmatic)

Magic is an SDK for developers to create passwordless and social and email logins. Magic makes dapps authentication and key management easy, like a web2 experience, and removes headaches for developers.

## Chainlink

Chainlink’s decentralized oracle will be launching on Harmony. This integration will provide off-chain data resources via Chainlink oracles to users of Harmony, giving developers price feeds and other off-chain data to use in their applications. This move is critical, especially as Harmony draws more of its attention to DeFi applications and cross-border finance.

## Band Protocol

Our integration with Band gives developers another option for accessing off-chain data on Harmony, a much greater selection of data formats and types, and different ways of interacting with off-chain data based on the developer’s preferences unlocked through Band Protocol’s custom oracle scripts.
