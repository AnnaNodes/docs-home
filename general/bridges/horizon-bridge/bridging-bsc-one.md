# Bridging BSC <> ONE

![BSC <> ONE Bridge](../../../.gitbook/assets/bridge-one-bsc.jpg)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do NOT send bridged tokens directly to other blockchains or exchanges. This will not work and it might result in **permanent loss** of your tokens. Bridged tokens can only be used on Harmony network. The only way to send them out is by bridging them back.
{% endhint %}

### Swapping BSC > ONE Tokens

1\. Head over to [bridge.harmony.one](https://bridge.harmony.one)

2\. Connect your Metamask account to [Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html) and connect your OneWallet or [Metamask](../../wallets/browser-extensions-wallets/metamask-wallet/) to the Harmony Mainnet.

3\. After confirming the token amount, select your Harmony ONE address on which you would like to receive your tokens.

4\. Select a BEP20 token from the left (or fill in the contract address). As an example, BUSD is used in this guide. When all fields are correctly filled in click on **Continue** to perform the bridge action.

9\. You can now close the last screen at the bottom of the page by clicking on the **Close** button. You can also choose to do this in the opposite direction, from Harmony to BSC.

10\. In order to see the tokens you might need to [add the tokens](adding-tokens.md) to your wallet.

### Swapping ONE > BSC Tokens

For swapping BEP-20 tokens for BEP-20 tokens the process is very similar. Make sure you select ONE -> Binance on top as we want to convert from Harmony to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) this time:

{% hint style="info" %}
The remaining process is pretty much the same as the one mentioned on the section before. You will need to confirm a few transactions as they pop up on your selected wallet.
{% endhint %}
