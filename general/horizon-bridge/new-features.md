# New Features

Horizon bridge currently supporting bridging BUSD, LINK, and any ERC20 token from Ethereum to Harmony and back. In this feature release we have added the following three major features:

1. ETH bridging
   * Allows bridging native ETH from Ethereum to receive 1ETH on Harmony
2. ERC721 (NFT) bridging
   * Allows single or in batch bridging of ERC721 (or NFTs) to Harmony to receive HRC721
3. ONE & HRC20 bridging
   * Allows bridging Harmony's native ONE token and any HRC20 issued on Harmony to Ethereum for utilizing Ethereum ecosystem and DApps 

## ETH Bridging

For bridging ETH to Harmony, select ETH under ETH > ONE tab enter a valid amount and proceed

For redeeming your ETH back to Ethereum by burning 1ETH, select ETH under ONE > ETH tab, enter a valid amount and proceed

## ERC721 Bridging

Over 8000+ ERC721s (NFTs) existing on Ethereum (e.g., Sorare, Unstoppable Domains) can be bridged to Harmony and traded at darn low gas fees.

You can bridge any ERC721 and receive equivalent amount of HRC721. The token metadata in the form of baseURI and tokenURI are preserved.

For bridging ERC721 from Ethereum to Harmony, select ERC721 under ETH > ONE flow tab and select the tokenIds that you want to bridge and proceed. 1 or more tokenIds can be selected for bridging. In the picture below, I am bridging both of my tokens with tokenIds 0 & 1. The tokenIds can be any valid uint256.

For redeeming your ERC721 back to Ethereum by burning HRC721, select ERC721 under ONE > ETH flow tab and select the tokenIds that you want to bridge back and proceed. In the picture below, I am only bridging back 1 token with tokenId 0.

## ONE & HRC20 Bridging

With this feature, Harmony users can now take their ONE tokens and HRC20s to Ethereum and utilized the ecosystem and DApps available in Ethereum. 

For bridging ONE tokens from Harmony to Ethereum, select ONE under ONE > ETH flow tab and enter a valid amount of ONE tokens to bridge to Ethereum and proceed.

For redeeming back the bridged ONE tokens back from Ethereum to Harmony, select ONE under ETH > ONE flow tab and enter a valid amount of 1ONE tokens to bridge back from Ethereum to Harmony and proceed.

For bridging HRC20 tokens from Harmony to Ethereum, select HRC20 under ONE > ETH flow tab and proceed with entering a valid amount of HRC20 tokens to bridge from Harmony to Ethereum and proceed.

For redeeming back the bridged HRC20 tokens back from Ethereum to Harmony, select HRC20 under ETH > ONE flow tab and proceed with entering a valid amount of 1HRC20 tokens to bridge back from Ethereum to Harmony and proceed.
