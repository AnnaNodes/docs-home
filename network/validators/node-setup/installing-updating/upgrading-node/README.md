# Updating A Node

There are three ways of updating the Node:

* [Using Binary](using-binary.md) \(**recommended**\): Node Binary allows you to have full control of all the node configuration settings. Node configuration with this option is manual.
* [Using AutoNode](using-autonode.md) \(**recommended**\): AutoNode allows you to spin up a node seamlessly and automate common validator actions. Node configuration with this option is automated.
* [Using Node.sh](using-node.sh.md) \(not recommended\): Node.sh is a wrapper to run the Binary CLI. It will be deprecated and is not recommended for new installations anymore.
