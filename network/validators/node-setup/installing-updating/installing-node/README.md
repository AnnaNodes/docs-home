# Installing A Node

There are three ways of installing the Node:

* [Using Binary](using-binary.md) \(**recommended**\): Node Binary allows you to have full control of all the node configuration settings. Node configuration with this option is manual.
* [Using AutoNode](https://docs.harmony.one/home/validators/under-construction/installing-node/using-autonode/install-and-run) \(**deprecated**\): AutoNode allows you to spin up a node seamlessly and automate common validator actions. Node configuration with this option is automated. It is now deprecated and is not recommended for new installations anymore.
* [Using Node.sh](https://docs.harmony.one/home/validators/under-construction/installing-node/using-node.sh) \(**deprecated**\): Node.sh is a wrapper to run the Binary CLI. It is now deprecated and is not recommended for new installations anymore.
