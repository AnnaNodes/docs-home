balajis.com @balajis · Jun 11 Replying to @matthew\_d\_green Yes. But here’s a possibly dumb workaround:

1\) A listens for events on chain 2) B sends a decryption request for resource to A’s address 3) A returns decrypted version, re-encrypted with B’s public key, if in a valid time window

Sort of like multisig with restrictions?&#x20;

stephen tse | s.one @stse · Jul 3 smartotp by @IHomoliak has a research paper & a prototype - with a wallet for private keys

"keyless wallet" by @dionyziz has a theoretical result assuming witness encryption

our @1wallet\_ by @polymorpher has a mainnet demo with hardened client security

nick.eth @nicksdjohnson · Jun 11 Replying to @AutismCapital 2FA only works when you have a central service that controls access to your data. The wallet equivalent of 2FA is a hardware wallet.&#x20;

stephen tse | s.one @stse · Jul 4 why can't public and decentralized platforms do 2fa services?

Pedro Gomes 🦇🔊📲 @pedrouid · Feb 13 Replying to @zmanian I think it’s also due to user demand

A pure wallet would essentially just display different signing authorization screens without a specific use-case

Cryptocurrency wallets on the other hand transfer funds, show balances, etc&#x20;

stephen tse | s.one @stse · Jul 4 how about separating wallets from authenticator? with one-time-password (otp) like google auth
