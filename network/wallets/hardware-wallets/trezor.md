# Trezor

Trezor wallet can be used along with Metamask to perform ONE transfers on Harmony network. Follow the steps below.

![1. Add Harmony network to metamask (testnet or mainnet)](../../../.gitbook/assets/harmony-mainnet.png)

![2. Select "Connect Hardware Wallet"](<../../../.gitbook/assets/begin (1) (1).png>)

![3. Select Trezor and continue](../../../.gitbook/assets/metamask-trezor.png)

![4. Select account, mostly the first one](<../../../.gitbook/assets/select-account (1).png>)

![5. Account loaded](<../../../.gitbook/assets/account-loaded (1).png>)

![6. Click on Send and prepare the transaction](../../../.gitbook/assets/prepare-tx.png)

![7. Confirm the transaction](../../../.gitbook/assets/confirm.png)

![8. Use the Trezor hardware wallet device to confirm the transaction. Upon confirming, the transaction is successful.](<../../../.gitbook/assets/result (1).png>)

Note that, load the Ethereum firmware (or app) for signing the transactions on the trezor device. Currently, Harmony does not have a separate trezor firware. There is a [bounty](https://github.com/harmony-one/bounties/issues/29) for adding Harmony to trezor firmware. After this bounty is finished, the users will be able to both transfer ONE and perform staking using trezor using Harmony firmware (or app).
