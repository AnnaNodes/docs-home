Trust Wallet is a mobile cryptocurrency wallet. Please visit [https://trustwallet.com](https://trustwallet.com) with your mobile device to download the app. Users can **stake** in Harmony using Trust Wallet.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**

Please note that Trust Wallet does not support Harmony's sharded network architecture yet, so **all transactions to or from Trust Wallet must go through shard 0.** You can only view and access your funds in shard 0.
{% endhint %}

### Incoming transactions

The funds that are sent within shard 0 will be viewed correctly in Trust Wallet.

If you receive funds in a shard other than shard 0 \(i.e. in shard 2\), you will not see the transaction receipt in the Trust Wallet app. Since your account balance will only show the funds in shard 0, your total balance will not change.

### Outgoing transactions

Since there is no shard selection in the Trust Wallet UI, all transactions will originate from shard 0 and will be sent to shard 0.

### **For more details, please see these example cross-shard transactions using Trust Wallet:**
