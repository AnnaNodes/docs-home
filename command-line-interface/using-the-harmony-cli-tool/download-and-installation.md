# Download and installation

There are multiple ways to get the `hmy` CLI binary.

## Precompiled version

Get the `OS X` version [here](download-and-installation.md) with `md5` checksum `0d84aa15a4c98b85b90cedc4fa260082` \(you can check yourself with `md5 < hmy`\)

Get the `Linux` x86-64 version [here](download-and-installation.md)

## Compiling from source

If you are interested in compiling from source, then the process is slightly more involved.
