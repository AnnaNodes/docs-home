# Grant Proposals

In order to continue to grow the Harmony protocol and ecosystem, Harmony has established a Grant Program. [The details of the program are highlighted in this Blog Post](https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmony-grant-guideline-58ff9cec02a6).

In what follows below is some information, but go read the [blog post](https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmony-grant-guideline-58ff9cec02a6) for a more comprehensive and most up-to-date information.

Applicants can apply for grants to build core protocol features, developer tooling, and critical applications including wallets and financial applications.

### Ecosystem and Protocol Incentives

We plan to actively use our ecosystem and protocol monthly unlocking tokens, see [https://harmony.one/unlock](https://harmony.one/unlock).

Every month, our model ****unlocks **62 million ecosystem tokens** to boost growth in our applications and users plus **92 million protocol tokens** to boost growth in our developers and tooling.

### Areas of Focus

We will provide grants to decentralized finance \(DeFi\) projects with 1,000+ users and to wallets with 10,000+ users that are fully integrated with our mainnet.

Also, we will give grants to blockchain hackers to build BTC/ETH bridges and Truffle tooling and fintech developers to create identity and currency gateways that are fully integrated with our mainnet and SDK.

Get started today by submitting a proposal to grants@harmony.one.
