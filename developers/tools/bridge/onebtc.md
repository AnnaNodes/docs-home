# OneBTC

The _BTC Bridge_ connects the Harmony ecosystem with Bitcoin. It allows the creation of _ONEBTC_, a fungible token that represents Bitcoin in the Harmony ecosystem. ONEBTC is backed by Bitcoin 1:1 and allows redeeming of the equivalent amount of Bitcoins by relying on a collateralized third-party.
