{% hint style="info" %}
When running a localnet, there is no need to setup a faucet to receive $ONE for testing because upon spinning up the localnet, the node creates several accounts that earn rewards for signing blocks.

Their keystore files are made available wherever you setup Harmony $ONE on your machine ~/harmony-one/harmony/tree/main/.hmy/keystore

Feel free to ping any POPS member for issues on the testnet network/explorer/faucet on harmony discord @harmony-pops or telegram [P-OPS Team Validator](https://t.me/POPS_Team_Validator)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
P-OPS Testnet Faucet can be refilled by sending testnet $ONE to the contract address shown on the faucet site https://faucet.pops.one
