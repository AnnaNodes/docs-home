# Smart Contracts

### Writing our first Counter Smart Contract

In the contracts folder create a new file `Counter.sol` and add the following code block to it:

```javascript
pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.8.0;

contract Counter {
    uint256 private count = 0;
    uint256 moneyStored = 0;

    function incrementCounter() public {
        count += 1;
    }
    function decrementCounter() public {
        count -= 1;
    }

    function addMoney() payable public {
        moneyStored += msg.value;
    }

    function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {
        return count;
    }

    function getMoneyStored() public view returns (uint256){
        return moneyStored;
    }
}

```

In the migrations folder create another new file called `2_Counter.js` and add the following code block:

```javascript
const Migrations = artifacts.require("Counter");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(Migrations);
};
```

### Checking the Solidity Smart Contract

```text
truffle compile
```

If all was done correctly you should see something like this:

```text
