# IPFS & Filecoin

**IPFS** is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data. It is great for getting started using content addressing for all sorts of distributed web applications.

Built on the content addressing of IPFS, **Filecoin** is the distributed storage network to add longer term data persistence via on-chain storage deals, along with built-in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time.

Together, IPFS & Filecoin will  help breaking free from centralized services. There are many solutions combine the two networks to get the best of both worlds: IPFS for content addressing & data discovery, and Filecoin for longer-term persistence.

In this section, you will find tutorials to guide you through the process of using IPFS and/or Filecoin for decentralized storage, including storage helpers that combine both systems such as  [nft.storage](https://nft.storage/).
