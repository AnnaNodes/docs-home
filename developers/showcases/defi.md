# DeFi

## Maker

Maker is a permission-less lending platform and a decentralized stablecoin. 

It allows any user to autonomously take out a loan (denominated in Dai) by staking digital assets as collateral. There are no KYC requirements and all lending actions are performed by smart contracts. The native token MKR is used for governance and stability fees.

## **SeeSWAP (Balancer)**

Balancer is an asset management platform that acts as an automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor. 

A native governance token BAL is used to vote on protocol upgrades including supported collateral, fees, and incentives. BAL can be earned through the Liquidity Mining program which grants users token for providing liquidity to Balancer Pools.

## **Curve**

Curve makes use of liquidity pools and bonding curves to provide high-efficiency stablecoin trading and low-risk returns for liquidity providers.

With Curve, users aren’t exposed to the price slippage they would normally face on DEXs when trading from one stablecoin to another. Curve lends assets when they aren’t being traded and gives that interest to liquidity providers.

## **1EARN (yEarn)**

yEarn is a liquidity aggregator providing automated yield farming strategy through a number of lending pools.

The native governance token YFI is earned through liquidity money on a number of different pools, and by staking proof of liquidity.
