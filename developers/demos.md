# Demos

## \*\*\*\*[**Soccerplayers**](https://soccerplayers-87d85.firebaseapp.com/)\*\*\*\*

**Soccer players app is sourced from an open source project. We are building it for technology demonstration, and not for commercial purposes. The open source project is running in Harmony Blockchain**

**This open source project is special because it gives you the chance to collect and own your favorite smart contract soccer player. If someone buys your player, you will get the amount as reward. The soccer player smart contracts are automatically placed on the marketplace, so others can collect them.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please keep in mind that all design of the players is irrelevant in this open source project, and may be subject to changes in the future, what is important is the smart contract that remains unique**
{% endhint %}

## [Harmony Punks](https://punks.hmy.cc.ink/#/home)

**Harmony Punks is a collection game, made by harmony characters, people can either claim a punk or buy punks from someone else. All characters are unique and collectible with proof of ownership stored on the blockchain.** 

**We adopt the playing mode of cryptopunks \(collection with bidding\), but need to add our own \(Harmony\) style and make the project a new project.**

## [Good One](http://crowdfunding.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/) 

**Good One is a simple crowdfunding dApp which will have the ‘minimum’ functionalities that you’d expect from a crowdfunding platform. Basically, one should be able to start crowdfunding projects, and fund them.**

* **Start Project — we should be able to start a new crowdfunding project, along with setting its details like goal amount, etc**
* **View Projects — we should be able to retrieve our existing projects’ details and display it**
* **Fund Project — we should be able to fund an existing project with ONE**
* **Retrieve Funds — in the case where a project does not meet its goal amount, and is past its deadline, funders should be able to retrieve their contributed funds \(All-or-Nothing setup\)**
