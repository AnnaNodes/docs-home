2\. Enter `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000FC` into the "Contract Address" field of the Contract Interaction form.

3\. Copy paste the text below into the ABI field in the Contract Interaction form

```
[
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "address",
          "name": "delegatorAddress",
          "type": "address"
        },
        {
          "internalType": "address",
          "name": "validatorAddress",
          "type": "address"
        },
        {
          "internalType": "uint256",
          "name": "amount",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Delegate",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "function"
    }
]
```

4\. Select "Delegate" from the drop-down.&#x20;

5\. Enter the delegator address (your multisig safe address) and validator address. Note that these have to be in the `0x` format and not `one1`. You can easily get the `0x` formatted address of your `one1` from [https://explorer.harmony.one](https://explorer.harmony.one) "Address Format" toggle on the top.

6\. Enter the amount of ONE to stake. Note that, you have to append 18 zeros to your number as the amount is expected in the `wei` units and not `ONE`. For example, if you want to stake 100 ONE, you will write 100000000000000000000 (notice the 18 zeros after 100).
